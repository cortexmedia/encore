## Installation

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'encore'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install encore
```

## Disclaimer

As Encore is under heavy development at the moment, we advise against using this gem in production unless you know exactly what you’re doing. *Breaking changes* are still being committed.

## Basic serializer usage

### Configure your serializer

```ruby
class CommentSerializer < Encore::Serializer::Base
  attributes :id, :body, :links

  # By default, root_key will be the pluralized model
  # name. If you want to set a custom root_key, you can
  # do that:
  def self.root_key
    :user_comments
  end
end
```

The `links` attribute is generated by Encore and will return the included associations. Read more in the [Inclusion](#inclusion) section.

### Returning serialized model

```ruby
class CommentsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :fetch_comments, only: %i(index)

  def index
    render json: Encore::Serializer::Instance.new(@comments)
  end

protected

  def fetch_comments
    @comments = Comment.all
  end
end
```

Will result in the following JSON output:

```json
{
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "body": "First!",
      "links": {}
    }
  ],
  "links": {},
  "linked": {},
  "meta": {
    "comments": {
      "page": 1,
      "count": 1,
      "page_count": 1,
      "previous_page": null,
      "next_page": null
    }
  }
```

### Inclusion

Encore can handle model associations. For example, let’s include the `author` in the code sample above.

```ruby
Encore::Serializer::Instance.new(@comments, include: 'author')
```

Since we don’t want all associations to be exposed, we also need to allow the serializer to include the association. To do so, we need to update the `CommentSerializer`.

```ruby
class CommentSerializer < Encore::Serializer::Base
  # ...

  def self.can_include
    [:author]
  end
end
```

This will result in the following JSON output:

```json
{
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "body": "First!",
      "links": {
        "author": "1"
      }
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "comments.author": {
      "href": "/authors?ids={author.id}",
      "type": "user"
    }
  },
  "linked": {
    "authors": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "name": "John Doe"
      }
    ]
  },
  "meta": {
    "comments": {
      "page": 1,
      "count": 1,
      "page_count": 1,
      "previous_page": null,
      "next_page": null
    }
  }
```

If you want the `author` the **always** be included when you request a `comment`, update the `CommentSerializer` this way:

```ruby
class CommentSerializer < Encore::Serializer::Base
  attributes :id, :body, :links

  def self.always_include
    [:author]
  end
end
```
